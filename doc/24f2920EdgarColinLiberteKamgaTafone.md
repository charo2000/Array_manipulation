## About
This is a small project to handle array manipulation in algorithms using the C language.  
It mainly focuses on the following notions:

- **Two-dimensional arrays**: used to represent matrices.
- **One-dimensional arrays**: used to represent simple arrays.
- **Dynamic allocation**: managing arrays in memory dynamically.

## Features
- Matrix sum
- Multiplication of two matrices
- Sequential search in an array
- Test if an array is sorted
- Vectorial product
- Reverse an array
- Multiply a matrix by a vector
- Median of an array
